# 🏛️ Regime-Aware AI Trading Command Center
### GDG HackFest 2026 · Hybrid Quant + Gemini Multi-Agent System

A **production-style agentic AI trading system** built using **Google ADK and Gemini 3**.

This project demonstrates how **AI agents can safely automate financial workflows** by combining:

- Deterministic Quantitative Models
- Multi-Agent AI Reasoning
- Risk Enforcement
- Paper Trading
- Observability Dashboard

This is a **real workflow automation system**, not a chatbot.

# Core Philosophy — Hybrid Quant + AI Agents

Most AI trading bots fail because:

- LLMs hallucinate numbers
- Risk management is ignored
- Bots revenge-trade after losses

## What This Project Does

The system performs seven core functions through an agentic AI architecture:

1. **Regime Detection** -- Fetches live Nifty 50 data and classifies the market as BULL, SIDEWAYS, or BEAR using technical indicators (50-DMA, trend slope, 20-day momentum).

2. **Breakout Scanning** -- Scans 20 of the most liquid Nifty 50 stocks for 20-day price breakouts with volume confirmation and trend alignment.

3. **Announcement Momentum Scanning** -- Fetches live news headlines for watchlist stocks and identifies announcement-driven momentum candidates (stocks with recent news + significant price move + above-average volume).

4. **Bull vs Bear Debate** -- Before any trade, a Bull Advocate argues FOR the trade and a Bear Advocate argues AGAINST, using real data. A Judge agent weighs both sides and delivers a BUY/SKIP verdict with a confidence percentage.

5. **Trade Planning** -- Calculates precise entry price, stop-loss (ATR-based), target price (2:1 reward-risk), position size (1% risk rule), and capital required.

6. **Paper Trade Execution** -- Simulates trade execution with full risk rule validation, updates the virtual portfolio, and persists state to disk.

7. **Portfolio Management** -- Tracks cash balance, open positions, invested capital, realized P&L, and trade history.

**What makes this "agentic":** The LLM (Gemini) acts as the reasoning layer that decides *which* tools to call and *how* to interpret results, while all calculations, data fetching, and risk enforcement are handled by deterministic Python tool functions. The LLM never computes indicators or overrides risk rules -- it orchestrates and explains. The adversarial debate pattern adds a layer where agents *collaborate through disagreement* to reach better trading decisions.

## Agentic Architecture Overview

This system follows the **Agent + Tools + Memory + Orchestration** pattern prescribed by Google ADK:

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        USER (Natural Language)                     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

## Deterministic Python — "The Handcuffs"

Python handles:

- Market data fetching
- Indicator calculations
- Market regime detection
- Position sizing
- Stop-loss calculation
- Risk enforcement

The AI **cannot override mathematics.**

---

## Gemini Agents — "The Brain"

Gemini is used only for:

- Market reasoning
- News interpretation
- Bull vs Bear debate
- Trade thesis generation

1. **User message** arrives at the `root_agent` (trading_assistant)
2. The root agent's LLM reads the user intent and decides which sub-agent to delegate to
3. ADK **transfers control** to the chosen sub-agent
4. The sub-agent's LLM decides which of its tools to call
5. Tool functions execute deterministically and return structured results
6. The sub-agent's LLM interprets the results and formulates a response
7. Control returns to the root agent, which may delegate to another sub-agent or respond to the user

### Agent Delegation Protocol

The root agent uses its `instruction` prompt to determine delegation:

| User Intent | Delegated To | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Market conditions, regime | `regime_analyst` | "What's the market doing?" |
| Stock scanning, finding opportunities | `stock_scanner` | "Scan for breakout stocks" |
| Announcement-driven momentum | `stock_scanner` | "Scan for news-driven movers" |
| Evaluate / debate a stock | `trade_debate_judge` | "Should I buy RELIANCE?" |
| Trade planning, execution | `trade_executor` | "Plan a trade for RELIANCE" |
| Portfolio queries, reset | `portfolio_manager` | "Show my portfolio" |
| Full workflow (scan-to-trade) | Sequential: regime -> scanner -> debate -> trade | "Run a full market scan and trade" |

### ADK Protocols Used

- **Agent-to-SubAgent Delegation:** Root agent uses ADK's `sub_agents` parameter. ADK handles context passing and response routing automatically.
- **Tool Registration:** Each sub-agent registers its tools via the `tools` parameter. ADK auto-generates tool schemas from Python function signatures and docstrings.
- **Session Management:** ADK maintains conversation history per session. The `InMemoryRunner` (for FastAPI) or ADK's built-in session service (for `adk web`) handles this.
- **Model Binding:** Each agent has `model=GEMINI_MODEL`, resolved once at startup via the fallback system.

# System Capabilities

### 1. Root Agent -- `trading_assistant`

**File:** `trading_agents/agent.py`

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `trading_assistant` |
| Role | Coordinator / Orchestrator |
| Model | Resolved via fallback (default: `gemini-2.5-flash`) |
| Tools | None (delegates everything) |
| Sub-agents | `regime_analyst`, `stock_scanner`, `trade_debate_judge`, `trade_executor`, `portfolio_manager` |

**What it does:**
- Receives all user messages
- Interprets intent using the LLM
- Delegates to the appropriate specialist sub-agent
- Can chain multiple sub-agents for complex workflows (e.g., "scan and trade" triggers regime check -> stock scan -> trade execution)
- Enforces response formatting rules (INR currency format, data source citation, paper trading disclaimer)

**What it does NOT do:**
- Never calls tools directly
- Never computes indicators or makes calculations
- Never overrides sub-agent decisions

---

## 1 — Market Regime Detection

Classifies the market into:

- BULL
- SIDEWAYS
- BEAR

Using:

- 50 DMA
- 200 DMA
- Trend slope
- 20-day returns

---

## 2 — Breakout Scanning

Scans Nifty50 stocks for:

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `stock_scanner` |
| Role | Breakout and announcement momentum scanning |
| Tools | `scan_watchlist_breakouts`, `get_stock_analysis`, `scan_announcement_momentum` |
| Data Source | Live stock data + news for 20 NSE stocks via Yahoo Finance |

**Two scanning strategies:**

**Strategy 1 -- Breakout Scan:**
- Iterates through the 20-stock NSE watchlist

# Quant Engine

Pure deterministic Python.

Indicators:

- 50 DMA
- 200 DMA
- ATR
- RSI
- MACD

---

## Regime Classification Rules

```
BULL:
Price > 50DMA > 200DMA

BEAR:
Price < 50DMA < 200DMA

Otherwise:
NEUTRAL
```

**Strategy 2 -- Announcement Momentum Scan:**
- Iterates through the NSE watchlist
- For each stock: fetches OHLCV data + live news headlines
- Identifies stocks with all three conditions:
  - Recent news (published within last 3 days)
  - Significant price move (> 2% in 5 days)
  - Above-average volume (volume ratio > 1.0)
- Returns candidates with news headlines for the agent to interpret
- The LLM classifies whether news is material (earnings, buyback, M&A, contracts) vs. noise

When asked to scan broadly, the agent runs BOTH strategies and presents combined results.

---

### 4. Trade Debate Judge -- `trade_debate_judge` (Bull vs Bear)

**File:** `trading_agents/debate_agent.py`

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `trade_debate_judge` |
| Role | Adversarial evaluation of trade candidates |
| Tools | `analyze_stock_for_debate` |
| Sub-agents | `bull_advocate`, `bear_advocate` |

This agent implements the **adversarial debate pattern** -- two opposing agents argue for and against a trade, then a judge delivers the verdict.

**Debate Protocol:**

```
Step 1: Judge delegates to bull_advocate
        Bull fetches stock data + news, argues FOR the trade
        (cites: breakout confirmation, volume, DMA alignment, positive catalysts)

Step 2: Judge delegates to bear_advocate
        Bear fetches stock data + news, argues AGAINST the trade
        (cites: overextension, weak volume, negative news, resistance levels)

Step 3: Judge reads both arguments and delivers:
        - VERDICT: BUY or SKIP
        - CONFIDENCE: 0-100%
        - BULL SUMMARY: strongest bull points
        - BEAR SUMMARY: strongest bear points
        - REASONING: 2-3 sentence synthesis
```

**Sub-agent: `bull_advocate`**
- Constructs the strongest possible case FOR buying
- Has access to `analyze_stock_for_debate` tool (technicals + news)
- Always argues bullish, citing specific data points

**Sub-agent: `bear_advocate`**
- Constructs the strongest possible case AGAINST buying
- Has access to `analyze_stock_for_debate` tool (technicals + news)
- Always argues bearish, citing risks and concerns

Both advocates independently fetch and analyze data, ensuring genuine adversarial perspectives rather than a single model arguing with itself.

---

### 5. Trade Executor -- `trade_executor`

Hard safety layer.

Prevents:

- Oversized trades
- Unrealistic stops
- Bad reward/risk
- High volatility trades

AI cannot bypass risk rules.

---

### 6. Portfolio Manager -- `portfolio_manager`

| Rule | Value |
|------|------|
Risk per trade | 1%
Stop Loss | 1.5×ATR
Reward/Risk | ≥1.5
Max Trades | Limited
Execution | Paper only

---

## Detailed Tool Documentation

### Data Layer Tools (`tools/market_data.py`)

#### `fetch_index_data(symbol, days)`

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `symbol` | `"^NSEI"` | Yahoo Finance ticker for the index |
| `days` | `140` | Calendar days of history to fetch |

**What it returns:**
- `closes`, `highs`, `lows`, `volumes` -- arrays of daily OHLCV data
- `latest_close` -- most recent closing price
- `last_5_closes` -- proof of data freshness
- `last_trade_date` -- timestamp of the most recent trading day

- `source` -- always `"Yahoo Finance (yfinance)"`

**Error handling:** Returns `{"status": "error", "error_message": "..."}` if the market is closed, symbol is invalid, or fewer than 60 trading days are available.

#### `fetch_stock_data(symbol, days)`

Same as `fetch_index_data` but automatically appends `.NS` suffix for NSE stocks (e.g., `"RELIANCE"` becomes `"RELIANCE.NS"`).

---

### News Data Tools (`tools/news_data.py`)

#### `fetch_stock_news(symbol)`

Fetches recent news articles for a stock using yfinance's `.news` property.

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `symbol` | (required) | NSE stock ticker (e.g. `"RELIANCE"` or `"RELIANCE.NS"`) |

**What it returns:**
- `articles` -- list of recent news articles, each with:
  - `title` -- headline text
  - `summary` -- article summary
  - `published` -- ISO timestamp of publication
  - `publisher` -- source name (e.g. "Reuters", "Economic Times")
  - `days_ago` -- computed age of the article in days
- `article_count` -- number of articles found
- `fetched_at_ist` -- IST timestamp of the API call
- Articles are sorted by recency (newest first)

---

### Debate Tools (`debate_agent.py`)

#### `analyze_stock_for_debate(symbol)`

Combines technical analysis and news data into a single comprehensive view for debate evaluation.

**What it returns:**
- `technicals` -- full output from `get_stock_analysis()` (close, 20d high, volume ratio, DMA, ATR, breakout status)
- `news` -- full output from `fetch_stock_news()` (headlines, summaries, dates, publishers)

Used by `bull_advocate`, `bear_advocate`, and `trade_debate_judge` to independently verify claims.

---

### Technical Analysis Tools (`tools/technical.py`)

#### `compute_index_metrics(closes)`

Requires at least 60 daily closing prices.

**Calculations:**

| Metric | Formula | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `close` | `closes[-1]` | Latest closing price |
| `dma_50` | `mean(closes[-50:])` | Simple 50-day moving average |
| `dma_50_slope` | `dma_50_today - dma_50_5days_ago` | Trend direction of the 50-DMA. Computed as: `mean(closes[-50:]) - mean(closes[-55:-5])` |
| `return_20d` | `(closes[-1] / closes[-21]) - 1` | 20-trading-day price return (percentage) |
| `volatility` | `pstdev(daily_returns[-20:]) * sqrt(252)` | Annualized volatility from 20-day daily returns |

#### `compute_atr(highs, lows, closes, period=14)`

Average True Range -- measures average daily price volatility.

**Formula:**

```
What is the market regime?
```

```
Scan for breakout stocks
```

```
Analyze RELIANCE.NS
```

```
Plan a trade for TCS
```

```
Show portfolio
```

```
1. For each of the 20 NSE watchlist stocks:
   a. fetch_stock_data() pulls 140 days of OHLCV
   b. detect_breakout() checks:
      - Is today's close above the highest close of the previous 20 days?
      - Is today's volume at least 1.2x the 20-day average volume?
      - Is the stock trading above its 50-DMA?
   c. If all three are true --> it's a breakout candidate
2. Candidates are ranked by volume_ratio (highest first)
3. ATR is computed for each candidate (needed for trade planning)
4. LLM presents the results but does NOT filter or re-rank
```

### Announcement Momentum -- Step by Step

```
1. For each of the 20 NSE watchlist stocks:
   a. fetch_stock_data() pulls 140 days of OHLCV
   b. Calculate 5-day price change: (close / close_5_days_ago) - 1
   c. Calculate volume ratio: today's volume / 20-day average volume
   d. Check momentum criteria:
      - |5-day price change| > 2% (significant move in either direction)
      - volume ratio > 1.0 (above-average activity)
   e. If momentum criteria met, fetch news via fetch_stock_news()
   f. Filter for recent news (published within last 3 days)
   g. If recent news exists --> it's an announcement momentum candidate
2. Candidates are ranked by absolute price change (largest move first)
3. Direction labeled BULLISH (positive move) or BEARISH (negative move)
4. LLM interprets news headlines to determine if announcement is material
```

### Bull vs Bear Debate -- Step by Step

```
1. trade_debate_judge receives "evaluate RELIANCE"
2. Delegates to bull_advocate:
   - Bull calls analyze_stock_for_debate("RELIANCE")
   - Gets technicals (breakout status, DMA, volume, ATR) + news
   - Constructs data-backed argument FOR buying
   - Returns bullish case with specific numbers
3. Delegates to bear_advocate:
   - Bear calls analyze_stock_for_debate("RELIANCE")
   - Gets the same data independently
   - Constructs data-backed argument AGAINST buying
   - Returns bearish case with specific risks
4. Judge reads both arguments, optionally verifies claims
5. Delivers verdict: BUY/SKIP + confidence % + synthesis
```

### Trade Execution -- Step by Step

```
1. plan_trade(symbol, close, atr):
   - Calculates stop = entry - 1.5*ATR
   - Calculates target = entry + 2*(entry - stop)
   - Loads portfolio to check available cash
   - Sizes position: qty = floor(1% of cash / risk_per_share)
   - Returns the plan (no side effects)

2. LLM presents plan to user, waits for confirmation

3. execute_trade(symbol, entry, stop, target, qty):
   - Loads portfolio from disk
   - Validates: max trades not exceeded
   - Validates: stop < entry
   - Validates: reward:risk >= 2.0
   - Validates: sufficient cash (auto-adjusts qty if needed)
   - Deducts cash from portfolio
   - Creates Position record
   - Logs the action
   - Saves portfolio to disk
   - Returns execution confirmation
```

| Max open positions | 3 | `paper_trading.py` -- `execute_paper_trade()` |
| Minimum reward:risk | 2:1 | `paper_trading.py` -- `execute_paper_trade()` |
| Stop-loss distance | 1.5 x ATR | `paper_trading.py` -- `calculate_trade_plan()` |
| No trading in BEAR regime | Strategy = NO_TRADE | `regime_agent.py` -- `analyze_regime()` (advisory, enforced by LLM instruction) |
| Volume confirmation | > 1.2x 20-day average | `technical.py` -- `detect_breakout()` |
| Trend alignment | Close must be above 50-DMA | `technical.py` -- `detect_breakout()` |
| Minimum data | 60 trading days required | `market_data.py` and `technical.py` |
| Auto-scale on low cash | Reduces qty to fit available cash | `paper_trading.py` -- `execute_paper_trade()` |
| Action log cap | Last 50 entries only | `portfolio.py` -- `save_portfolio()` |

- **Created automatically** on first trade or portfolio query
- **Schema:**

```json
{
  "cash": 1000000.0,
  "open_positions": [
    {
      "symbol": "RELIANCE.NS",
      "qty": 78,
      "entry": 2800.0,
      "stop": 2672.5,
      "target": 3055.0,
      "opened_at": "2026-02-21 16:00 IST"
    }
  ],
  "closed_trades": [],
  "realized_pnl": 0.0,
  "actions_log": [
    "[2026-02-21 16:00 IST] OPEN RELIANCE.NS qty=78 entry=2800.00 stop=2672.50 target=3055.00"
  ]
}
```

Portfolio state survives server restarts. The actions log is capped at 50 entries.

## Web Dashboard

The project includes a **FastAPI-powered web dashboard** with a dark-themed UI.

**File:** `server/app.py` (backend), `server/static/` (frontend)

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | GET | Serves the HTML dashboard |
| `/api/chat` | POST | Sends a message to the root agent, returns AI response |
| `/api/regime` | GET | Calls `analyze_regime()` directly, returns regime data |
| `/api/portfolio` | GET | Returns current portfolio summary |
| `/api/portfolio/reset` | POST | Resets portfolio to initial state |

### Dashboard Layout

+-------------------------------------------+-------------------+
```

### How the Dashboard Communicates with the Agent

1. User types a message in the chat input
2. Frontend sends `POST /api/chat` with `{"message": "..."}` 
3. Backend creates an ADK `InMemoryRunner` session
4. Message is sent to the `root_agent` via `runner.run_async()`
5. Agent processes the request (may delegate to sub-agents, call tools)
6. All response text parts are collected and joined
7. Response is returned as `{"reply": "..."}` to the frontend
8. Regime and portfolio cards are refreshed independently via their own API endpoints

## Model Fallback System

To handle Gemini API rate limits and outages (common during hackathons), the system automatically probes models at startup:

**File:** `trading_agents/config.py`

**Fallback order:**

| Priority | Model | Characteristics |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `gemini-3-flash-preview` | Latest, fastest |
| 2 | `gemini-2.5-flash` | Stable, reliable |
| 3 | `gemini-2.0-flash` | Older, very available |
| 4 | `gemini-2.5-pro` | More powerful, usually low traffic |

At startup, `_pick_available_model()` sends a minimal `"ping"` request to each model in order. The first model that responds successfully is used for all agents. Startup logs show which model was selected:

```
[config] gemini-3-flash-preview unavailable (503), trying next...
[config] Using model: gemini-2.5-flash
```

## Project Completion Status

### Version Roadmap

This project was designed with a three-phase roadmap:

| Version | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **V1 -- Hackathon MVP** | Regime + single strategy + paper trading | **COMPLETED** |
| V2 -- Enhanced Intelligence | Multi-strategy, adaptive allocation, performance tracking | Not started |
| V3 -- Production System | Full portfolio engine, broker integration, live execution | Not started |

### V1 Completion Checklist

| Component | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-agent architecture (ADK) | Done | Root + 5 sub-agents + 2 debate sub-agents (7 total) |
| Live market data (yfinance) | Done | NSE index + 20 stock watchlist |
| Live news data (yfinance) | Done | Stock news headlines for announcement detection |
| Regime classification (BULL/SIDEWAYS/BEAR) | Done | Deterministic rules on 50-DMA, slope, momentum |
| Breakout scanner (20-day high + volume) | Done | Scans all 20 watchlist stocks |
| Announcement momentum scanner | Done | News + price move + volume confirmation |
| Bull vs Bear debate system | Done | Adversarial evaluation with BUY/SKIP verdict |
| Trade planning (entry/stop/target/qty) | Done | ATR-based stops, 1% risk sizing |
| Paper trade execution | Done | Full risk validation, portfolio updates |
| Portfolio persistence (JSON) | Done | Cash, positions, P&L, trade history |
| Risk rules (hardcoded) | Done | 1% risk, max 3 trades, 2:1 R:R, no bear trading |
| Web dashboard (FastAPI) | Done | Chat + regime card + portfolio card |
| Model fallback system | Done | Auto-probes 4 Gemini models at startup |
| LLM reasoning and explanation | Done | Agent explains every decision with data |
| Data source transparency | Done | Every response includes source + IST timestamp |

### Is This an Agentic AI System?

**Yes.** This system satisfies the core requirements of an agentic AI architecture:

| Agentic Property | How It's Implemented |
|---|---|
| **Autonomous reasoning** | The LLM decides which sub-agent to delegate to and how to interpret tool results |
| **Tool use** | 11 deterministic tool functions registered with ADK and called by agents |
| **Multi-agent orchestration** | Root agent coordinates 5 sub-agents (7 total agents including debate sub-agents) |
| **Adversarial reasoning** | Bull and Bear agents debate trade decisions from opposing perspectives before a Judge delivers a verdict |
| **Memory / State** | Portfolio state persists to disk across sessions |
| **Human-in-the-loop** | Trade plans are shown before execution; user confirms via chat |
| **Explainability** | Every decision includes reasoning, metrics, data source, and timestamp |
| **Safety guardrails** | Risk rules are hardcoded in Python, not LLM-decided |

### What V2 Would Add

- Multiple strategies (pullback, dividend momentum) alongside trend breakout
- Adaptive capital allocation (agent decides weight per strategy)
- Performance-aware trading (win rate tracking, drawdown monitoring)
- Scheduled/continuous scanning instead of on-demand only
- Trade closing (currently only opens, no close/exit functionality)
- Live P&L tracking using current market prices

### What V3 Would Add

- Real broker integration (Zerodha/Angel One API)
- Portfolio-level risk engine (correlation, diversification scoring)
- Volatility targeting and scenario stress testing
- Kill-switch and loss limits
- User risk profiling
- Audit log and compliance layer

# Why This Project Stands Out

| Prompt | What Happens |
|---|---|
| "What is the current market regime?" | Fetches live Nifty 50 data, computes metrics, classifies regime |
| "Scan for breakout stocks" | Scans all 20 watchlist stocks for breakout candidates |
| "Scan for news-driven movers" | Scans watchlist for announcement momentum candidates |
| "Analyze RELIANCE" | Single-stock breakout analysis with ATR |
| "Should I buy RELIANCE?" | Runs Bull vs Bear debate, delivers BUY/SKIP verdict with confidence |
| "Debate TCS" | Full adversarial evaluation with bull case, bear case, and judge verdict |
| "Plan a trade for TCS at 4200 with ATR 85" | Calculates entry, stop, target, position size |
| "Execute the trade" | Validates risk rules and opens the paper position |
| "Show my portfolio" | Displays cash, positions, P&L, recent actions |
| "Reset portfolio" | Resets to INR 10,00,000 with no positions |
| "Run a full market scan and trade" | Regime -> scan -> debate -> trade planning -> execution |
